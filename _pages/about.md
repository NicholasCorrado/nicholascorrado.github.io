I am a Computer Sciences PhD candidate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison advised by [Josiah Hanna](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jphanna/). My research interests are in reinforcement learning, and I'm currently focusing on the role of representation learning in data efficient RL. I am also a research intern at Sandia National Laboratories working on applications of RL to power grid management.

During my first year, I worked with [Jignesh Patel](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jignesh/)'s group building [Hustle](https://github.com/UWHustle/hustle), 
an efficient data platform based built on top of Apache Arrow. I received a BPhil in physics and a B.S. in mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh where I worked with Professor Vladimir Savinov to design the first search for WbJ states.
