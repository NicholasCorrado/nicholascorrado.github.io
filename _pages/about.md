[//]: # (Towards this end, I've studied data augmentation, adaptive sampling, and representation learning techniques )

I am a Computer Sciences PhD candidate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison advised by [Josiah Hanna](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jphanna/). 
I am broadly interested in researching techniques to improve the data efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL).
Recently, my research has focused on 
1. Understanding the role of **data augmentation** in the context of RL and 
2. Demonstrating how **adaptive, off-policy sampling** can make on-policy learning more data efficient. 

Ultimately, my goal is to make RL a more viable tool for real-world tasks. 
Towards this end, **I've been using physical robotics tasks for my research in data augmentation**.
From 2021-2022, I was a research intern at Sandia National Laboratories working on RL for power grid management.
From 2022-2023, I transitioned to a consulting role for the same project.

During the first year of my PhD, I worked in databases with [Jignesh Patel's](https://jigneshpatel.org) group building [Hustle](https://github.com/UWHustle/hustle), 
an efficient data platform based built on top of Apache Arrow. 
I received a BPhil in physics and a B.S. in mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh where I worked with [Vladimir Savinov](https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/people/vladimir-savinov). 
For my thesis, I designed and optimized the first search for new hadronic WbJ states in data collected by the Belle Experiment.

Outside of research, [I am a jazz guitarist](https://www.youtube.com/@nicholascorrado3891/videos) &mdash; in fact, I almost pursued music professionally after high school.
I am heavily influenced by jazz manouche (commonly called gypsy jazz) but also draw inspiration from Bossa, Dixieland, and Modal jazz styles.
When I was 13, I had the great fortune of meeting and playing with [Joe Negri](https://pittsburghsymphony.org/pso_home/biographies/guest-artists/joe-negri) (aka ["Handyman Negri" from Mister Rogers' Neighborhood](http://www.neighborhoodarchive.com/mrn/characters/handyman_negri/index.html)). 
He is a jazz legend in my hometown of Pittsburgh and arguably one of the best jazz guitarists in the US.

I am always eager to discuss research and/or music. Feel free to send an email if you're interested in discussing anything!
